## Loan_approval

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), I have build a model that can predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan. This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan.
The data was taken from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club.
